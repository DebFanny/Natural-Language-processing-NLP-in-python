She was queen regnant of 32 sovereign states during of his life and 15 at the time of his death. [a] Her reign of 70 years and 214 days is the longest of any British monarch and the longest recorded of any female head of state in history. \"+\"Elizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth). Her father came to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother, King Edward VIII, making Elizabeth heir presumptive. She was educated privately at home and began taking public office during World War II, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in April 2021. They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew and Edward. \"+\"When her father died in February 1952, Elizabeth, then aged 25, became queen of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa , Pakistan and Ceylon (known today as Sri Lanka). as well as head of the Commonwealth. Elizabeth reigned as a constitutional monarch through major political changes such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland, devolution in the United Kingdom, decolonization of Africa, and the United Kingdom's membership of the European Communities and withdrawal of the European Union. The number of its kingdoms varied over time as territories gained independence and some kingdoms became republics. His many historic visits and meetings include state visits to China in 1986, Russia in 1994 and the Republic of Ireland in 2011, as well as meetings with five popes. \" +\"Significant events include Elizabeth's coronation in 1953 and the celebrations of her silver, gold, diamond and platinum jubilees in 1977, 2002, 2012 and 2022, respectively. Elizabeth was the longest-serving British monarch and the second longest-reigning sovereign in world history, behind only Louis XIV of France. She sometimes faced republican sentiment and media criticism of her family, particularly after the breakdown of her children's marriages, her annus horribilis in 1992, and the death of her former daughter-in-law Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997. However, support as the monarchy in the United Kingdom has remained consistently high, as has his personal popularity. Elizabeth died aged 96 at Balmoral Castle, Aberdeenshire in 2022, months after her platinum jubilee, and was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.\"\n",
