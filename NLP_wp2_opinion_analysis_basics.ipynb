            "Example with the first review: b\"arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts , since the late 80's , but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one-liners are getting worse . \\nit's hard seeing arnold as mr . freeze in batman and robin , especially when he says tons of ice jokes , but hey he got 15 million , what's it matter to him ? \\nonce again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster , that can't compare with the likes of the terminator series , true lies and even eraser . \\nin this so called dark thriller , the devil ( gabriel byrne ) has come upon earth , to impregnate a woman ( robin tunney ) which happens every 1000 years , and basically destroy the world , but apparently god has chosen one man , and that one man is jericho cane ( arnold himself ) . \\nwith the help of a trusty sidekick ( kevin pollack ) , they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world ! \\nparts of this are actually so absurd , that they would fit right in with dogma . \\nyes , the film is that weak , but it's better than the other blockbuster right now ( sleepy hollow ) , but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film . \\nanyway , this definitely doesn't seem like an arnold movie . \\nit just wasn't the type of film you can see him doing . \\nsure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known one-liners , but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going . \\nit's understandable , especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources . \\naside form that , he still walked through it , much like he has in the past few films . \\ni'm sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days . \\nspeaking of action , where was it in this film ? \\nthere was hardly any explosions or fights . \\nthe devil made a few places explode , but arnold wasn't kicking some devil butt . \\nthe ending was changed to make it more spiritual , which undoubtedly ruined the film . \\ni was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred , but once again i was let down . \\ni also don't know why the film took so long and cost so much . \\nthere was really no super affects at all , unless you consider an invisible devil , who was in it for 5 minutes tops , worth the overpriced budget . \\nthe budget should have gone into a better script , where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom . \\nit's pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie . \\ndo they even read these things anymore ? \\nit sure doesn't seem like it . \\nthankfully gabriel's performance gave some light to this poor film . \\nwhen he walks down the street searching for robin tunney , you can't help but feel that he looked like a devil . \\nthe guy is creepy looking anyway ! \\nwhen it's all over , you're just glad it's the end of the movie . \\ndon't bother to see this , if you're expecting a solid action flick , because it's neither solid nor does it have action . \\nit's just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing , due to a strategic marketing campaign . \\nsave your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience . \\n\"\n",

former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . \\\\nbeing the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet . \\\\nperhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . \\\\nall of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . \\\\napollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . \\\\njim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . \\\\nsuspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . \\\\nif they ever reach it . \\\\ned harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly . \\\\naudiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . \\\\nalso , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . \\\\nthe special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner . \\\\nwatch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . \\\\na bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . \\\\nthose who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . \\\\nthis is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . \\\\nyou should enjoy it . \\\\n\\\"\",\n          \"b'_dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential . \\\\nmitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs . \\\\nbut as the trailer goes , \\\" there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . \\\" \\\\nso he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . \\\\nthis should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit . \\\\nin fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam\\\\'s father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie . \\\\nso for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a \\\\nheart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise . \\\\nnot that there isn\\\\'t a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort . \\\\nthere are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam\\\\'s impotent father\\\\'s ongoing lust for them . \\\\nand for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america\\\\'s_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . \\\\nbut the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ? \\\\nthe answer is a resounding no . \\\\nit\\\\'s not that macdonald isn\\\\'t a funny guy . \\\\nhe was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn\\\\'t hurt that he\\\\'s a natural , likable screen presence . \\\\nhe is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don\\\\'t work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) . \\\\nstill , macdonald\\\\'s few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . \\\\nthe late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance . \\\\nsaget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time . \\\\nthe film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . \\\\ncome to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ . \\\\n'\",\n          \"b'while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general . \\\\nwords \\\" croatia \\\" and \\\" croatians \\\" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations . \\\\nthe rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth\\\\'s bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context . \\\\nin a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers\\\\' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise . \\\\nsame line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime . \\\\nthe movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe . \\\\nhis latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro . \\\\nshannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away . \\\\nafter being arrested and tortured by kimba\\\\'s secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) . \\\\nupon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d\\\\'etat against kimba . \\\\nshannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war . \\\\nthing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary . \\\\nit shouldn\\\\'t surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books . \\\\nthose plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman\\\\'s the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre . \\\\nthis one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires . \\\\nunlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work . \\\\nthe movie doesn\\\\'t try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda . \\\\nchristopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role . \\\\nhis performance in this film perhaps isn\\\\'t breathtaking , yet adequate . \\\\nhis notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the \\\" normal \\\" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends . \\\\nalthough the movie doesn\\\\'t lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken\\\\'s , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character . \\\\nhowever , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o\\\\'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon\\\\'s reluctant colleague . \\\\nthis was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director . \\\\nwith the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess . \\\\nluckily , the dogs of war had a good script . \\\\nirvin\\\\'s direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel . \\\\nthe only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places . \\\\nin the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes . \\\\nunfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn\\\\'t help . \\\\nbut , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama . \\\\n'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type_of_review\",\n      \"properties\":

former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . \\\\nbeing the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet . \\\\nperhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . \\\\nall of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . \\\\napollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . \\\\njim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . \\\\nsuspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . \\\\nif they ever reach it . \\\\ned harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly . \\\\naudiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . \\\\nalso , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . \\\\nthe special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner . \\\\nwatch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . \\\\na bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . \\\\nthose who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . \\\\nthis is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . \\\\nyou should enjoy it . \\\\n\\\"\",\n          \"b'_dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential . \\\\nmitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs . \\\\nbut as the trailer goes , \\\" there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . \\\" \\\\nso he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . \\\\nthis should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit . \\\\nin fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam\\\\'s father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie . \\\\nso for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a \\\\nheart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise . \\\\nnot that there isn\\\\'t a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort . \\\\nthere are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam\\\\'s impotent father\\\\'s ongoing lust for them . \\\\nand for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america\\\\'s_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . \\\\nbut the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ? \\\\nthe answer is a resounding no . \\\\nit\\\\'s not that macdonald isn\\\\'t a funny guy . \\\\nhe was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn\\\\'t hurt that he\\\\'s a natural , likable screen presence . \\\\nhe is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don\\\\'t work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) . \\\\nstill , macdonald\\\\'s few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . \\\\nthe late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance . \\\\nsaget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time . \\\\nthe film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . \\\\ncome to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ . \\\\n'\",\n          \"b'while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general . \\\\nwords \\\" croatia \\\" and \\\" croatians \\\" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations . \\\\nthe rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth\\\\'s bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context . \\\\nin a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers\\\\' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise . \\\\nsame line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime . \\\\nthe movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe . \\\\nhis latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro . \\\\nshannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away . \\\\nafter being arrested and tortured by kimba\\\\'s secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) . \\\\nupon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d\\\\'etat against kimba . \\\\nshannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war . \\\\nthing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary . \\\\nit shouldn\\\\'t surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books . \\\\nthose plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman\\\\'s the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre . \\\\nthis one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires . \\\\nunlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work . \\\\nthe movie doesn\\\\'t try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda . \\\\nchristopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role . \\\\nhis performance in this film perhaps isn\\\\'t breathtaking , yet adequate . \\\\nhis notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the \\\" normal \\\" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends . \\\\nalthough the movie doesn\\\\'t lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken\\\\'s , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character . \\\\nhowever , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o\\\\'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon\\\\'s reluctant colleague . \\\\nthis was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director . \\\\nwith the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess . \\\\nluckily , the dogs of war had a good script . \\\\nirvin\\\\'s direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel . \\\\nthe only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places . \\\\nin the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes . \\\\nunfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn\\\\'t help . \\\\nbut , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama . \\\\n'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type_of_review\",\n      \"properties\":
